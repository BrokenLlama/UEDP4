# ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE

## Issue Resolved
**Date:** $(date)
**Issue:** Environment variables with real API keys were exposed in the repository

## What Was Exposed
- Supabase URL and API keys
- Google Gemini API key
- Service role keys

## Actions Taken
1. âœ… **Immediately removed** `.env` file from repository
2. âœ… **Added** `.env` and `.env.backup` to `.gitignore`
3. âœ… **Created** `.env.example` template with placeholder values
4. âœ… **Committed** security changes to git
5. âœ… **Removed** backup file with exposed keys

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate All Exposed Keys
**URGENT:** You must immediately rotate/regenerate these keys:

#### Supabase Keys
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Regenerate the anon key and service role key
4. Update your local `.env` file with new keys

#### Google Gemini API Key
1. Go to Google AI Studio
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Delete the exposed key
4. Generate a new API key
5. Update your local `.env` file

### 2. Create New .env File
Copy the template and add your new keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your new API keys:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_new_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_service_role_key

# Google Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_gemini_key

# Optional: Custom cache duration (in milliseconds, default: 3600000 = 1 hour)
CACHE_DURATION=3600000

# Optional: Rate limit delay (in milliseconds, default: 1000 = 1 second)
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1000
```

### 3. Verify Security
- [ ] All old keys are invalidated
- [ ] New keys are working
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No sensitive data in git history

## Prevention Measures
1. **Never commit** `.env` files to git
2. **Always use** `.env.example` for templates
3. **Check** `.gitignore` before committing
4. **Use** environment variable validation
5. **Regular** security audits

## Git History
The exposed keys were in commit history. Consider:
- Force pushing to remove from remote history
- Using `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive data
- Creating a new repository if keys were widely exposed

If you need help with key rotation or have questions about this security incident, please contact your security team immediately.
